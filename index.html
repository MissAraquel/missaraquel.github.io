      <p>A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. I’m up to something.
